A _lot_ of these images were converted to SVG from the art from here:

https://thoseawesomeguys.com/prompts/

The original art is public domain (Creative Commons 0, or "CC0").

We're grateful to Nicolae (XELU) Berbece and Paul Paun for all their effort
and kindly giving it away!

Also thanks to Bekoha, who spent a ton of time on research and work to convert
the art to SVG format, and also contributed some original pieces.
